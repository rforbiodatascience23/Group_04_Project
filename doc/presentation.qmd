## Introduction

![](images/Introduction - Article.png)

-   CRC has the 3^rd^ highest mortality rate

-   More effective methods to detect CRC are needed

-   Correlation between exosomes and tumorigenesis

-   miRNA and mRNA can serve as biomarkers - these we want to find!

## GEO data

-   Using the library GEOquery, the data was loaded -\> no need to download any files

-   Both primary data and meta data was loaded and data was already standardized, though we still cleaned the data further

-   Majority of data comes from patients with earlier stage cancer

-   The patients are usually elderly people

## Data analysis - GSE

<font size="6">

-   Log2 Transformation:
    -   Data points below 0 were removed and converted to NaN.
-   Design Matrix for Tumor vs Normal Comparison:
-   Limit Expressed Genes Based on Median Expression:
    -   Only genes with above-median expression in 1/3 of the samples were retained.
-   Linear Model Fitting and Contrasts:
    -   A linear model was fitted.
    -   Contrasts were created between the two groups (Tumor and Normal).
    -   Empirical Bayes' step was performed to obtain statistics and p-values.
-   Array Weights for Model Fitting:
    -   An array of weights was created to fit the data into the model.
-   Empirical Bayes' Step (Again):
    -   The empirical Bayes' step was applied again with the array weights.
-   Tidying data

## Data retrieval - TCGA

<font size="6">

-   Fetch analyte.tsv & clinical.tsv from raw\_/

    -   Obtain IDs of the patients for whom the RNA expression was registered

-   Library ***TCGABiolinks*** is used to retrieve data from the GDC data portal

    -   Function: retrieve_and_prepare()

        -   GDCquery: Query to specify the data to get

        -   GDCdownload: Downloading the samples from the query

-   Example:

</font>

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
miRNA_data_cancer <- retrieve_and_prepare_data(
  project = "TCGA-COAD",
  data_category = "Transcriptome Profiling",
  data_type = "miRNA Expression Quantification",
  workflow_type = "BCGSC miRNA Profiling",
  id_cancer_patients = id_cancer_patients_cancer,
  directory_prefix = "samples_miRNA"
)
```

<font size="6">

-   miRNA data - 2 separate dataframes

-   mRNA data - ***Large*** ***SummarizedExperiment***

</font>

## Data description - TCGA

<font size="6">

-   Data tidying -
    -   "*Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way*"
-   Data visualizations:
    -   Number of cancer vs. normal samples
    -   Gender distribution
    -   Pathological cancer stages

</font>

## Data preprocess - TCGA

```{r}
library(tibble)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
own_path <- "/Users/mathildebechgaard"
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = paste0(own_path, "/group_04_project/data/"))
```

<font size="6">

-   Creating metadata for patients ID (TCGA \# - Tissue Status) for mRNAs and miRNAs.
-   Log2 transformation of two datasets and adjustment of the organizations. For them to have the same style of a **tidy data**: rows = gene names, columns = patients ID, value = expression data.

## Data augmentation - TCGA, edgeR

<font size="6">

-   Calculation of the normalization factors for the data (\_log) with `calcNormFactors` and imputation of NAs using means.

-   Running a "universal" edgeR differential analysis function with a quasi likelihood model.

## Results (All)

<font size="6">

-   Volcano Plot:
    -   Additional columns were created for volcano plotting:
        -   'diffexpressed' with values: NO, UP, and DOWN.
        -   'label' with GENE_ID's of overexpressed genes.

## Conclusions

-   Although we were able to follow the article's instructions, there are significant differences in our results. It might be brought on by some extra measures taken during data preprocessing, or by the authors' sparse information. It would be wise to get in touch with the authors to inquire further about preprocessing and data retrieval.

-   Overall, our analysis was carried out accurately, and the results did not indicate any grave errors.

-   In addition, data we used has different amount of sample in each stages, and stages differ between TCGA and GSE datasets
